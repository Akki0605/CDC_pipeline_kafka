##CDC with Debezium, Kafka, Postgres, Docker
Overview
This Python script is designed to generate simulated financial transactions and insert them into a PostgreSQL database. It's particularly useful for setting up a test environment for Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. The script uses the faker library to create realistic, yet fictitious, transaction data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table.

System Architecture

Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9+
psycopg2 library for Python
faker library for Python
PostgreSQL server running locally or accessible remotely
Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
Basic understanding of Docker, Kafka, and Postgres.
Installation
Install Required Python Libraries:
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install psycopg2-binary faker
Services in the Compose File
Zookeeper: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.
Kafka Broker: A distributed streaming platform that is used here for handling real-time data feeds.
Confluent Control Center: A web-based tool for managing and monitoring Apache Kafka.
Debezium: An open-source distributed platform for change data capture.
Debezium UI: A user interface for managing and monitoring Debezium connectors.
Postgres: An open-source relational database.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Ensure you have this Docker Compose file in your local system. If it's part of a repository, clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Docker Compose file.

Run Docker Compose: Execute the following command to start all services defined in the Docker Compose file:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will download the necessary Docker images, create containers, and start the services in detached mode.

Verify the Services: Check if all the services are up and running:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose ps
You should see all services listed as 'running'.

Accessing the Services:

Kafka Control Center is accessible at http://localhost:9021.
Debezium UI is accessible at http://localhost:8080.
Postgres is accessible on the default port 5432.
Shutting Down: To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Customization
You can modify the Docker Compose file to suit your needs. For example, you might want to persist data in Postgres by adding a volume for the Postgres service.

Note: This setup is intended for development and testing purposes. For production environments, consider additional factors like security, scalability, and data persistence.
